### What is this site about?
This is a personal website, a blog of sorts. I'll be posting about my experiences, my thoughts and my opinions on a variety of topics.

### How did I build this site?
I used Hugo, a static site generator written in Go. I did initially plan on writing this using SvelteKit , VuePress or NextJS but decided to go forth with Hugo since it seemed to be the most mature and well documented of the lot. Not to mention a good friend who convinced me that for a site that needed constant modifications and updates , I was better off using a static site generator rather than a full fledged framework. All of the content hosted on Cloudflare. There were webhooks from my GitHub repo that triggered rebuilds , but I have now scrapped that in lieu of building it locally. 

> PS : Almost everything I design follows the principles of Jonathan "Jony" Ive , so if you see a lot of white space and minimalism, you know why.
